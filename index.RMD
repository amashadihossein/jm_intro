## Motivation: Data Generation Mechanism

Multiple correlated repeated measures ~  Events that discontinue observation

![Data Generation Mechanism](libs/images/data_gen_mech.png)

## Motivation: Observed Data

What happens if the trajectories of the biomarkers are associated with the event?

## Motivation: Real Data Example

[Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cholangitis)
is an autoimmune disease affecting liver. As 
the disease advances, abnormally high levels of serum bilirubin can be observed.

312 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo:treatment (D-penicillamine) and were observed:


```{r pbc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.retina = 3, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

srv_d <- pbc2 %>% distinct(id, age, sex, drug, years, status) %>% 
  mutate(death = if_else(status == "dead", 1, 0))
srv_ft0 <- survfit(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug , data = srv_d)
srv_ft <- survfit(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug + sex, data = srv_d)

p0 <- ggsurvplot_facet(fit = srv_ft0, facet.by = "sex", 
                 data = srv_d,palette = "jama", pval = T) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype = 2) + custom_theme()

# p1 <- ggsurvplot(fit = srv_ft, data = srv_d,palette = "jco",legend = "bottom")+
#   guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 5))

p2 <- pbc2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = log(serBilir),colour = drug)) +
  facet_wrap(~sex, nrow = 2)+
  geom_smooth()+
  geom_line(aes(group = id), alpha = .2) +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("log (serum bilirubin)") +
  ggsci::scale_color_jama() +
  custom_theme()

p0+ p2 #+  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1))
```

## Motivation: Real Data Example

#### Combining longitudinal and TTE

<!-- JM package provides "followup [observation of] of 312 randomized patients with  -->
<!-- primary biliary cirrhosis, a rare autoimmune liver disease, at Mayo Clinic" -->

```{r pbc_i, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.retina = 3, fig.width=10}
set.seed(9)
pbc2 %>% distinct(id) %>% 
  sample_n(size = 16,replace = F) %>%
  left_join(x = ., y = pbc2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = log(serBilir))) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=years, linetype=factor(status!='dead')), lwd=.5) + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method='lm') +
  facet_wrap(~ id) +
  scale_x_continuous(name='Time (years)', limits=c(0,15)) +
  ylab("log (serum bilirubin)")+
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "status",breaks=c(FALSE, TRUE), values=c(1, 2),
                        labels=c('death', 'censored'))+
  custom_theme()+
  ggtitle("16 randomly selected cases")

## Motivation: Joint Modeling

<br> <br> <br> <br>

.pull-left[

- Relation of interest: serum bilirubin ~ death

- But death &#8594; missingness of serum bilirubin 

- This is a Missng Not at Random (MNAR) case

- Ignoring MNAR &#8594; wrong (biasd) estimate of _bili(t)_

- Also _bili(t)_ is endogenous wrspt TTE &#8594; inappropriate as time-dependent
covariate in a survival coxph model

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` need to solve **joint likelihood of
_bili(t)_ and death**

## Specifying the models*: longitudinal + TTE


.pull-left[
### 1. Biomarker(t) model:

$$y_i(t) = x_i(t) \beta + z_i(t) b_i + \epsilon_i(t) \; (1)$$
$$\eta_i(t) := E[y_i] = x_i(t) \beta + z_i(t) b_i$$

<br> <br> <br> 

- $y_i(t)$ is the observed value of biomarker at time $t$
- $\eta_i(t)$ is the unobserved true value of biomarker at time $t$
- $\beta$ is the vector of fix-effect parameters
- $b_i$ is the vector of random-effect parameters for subject $i$ ~ $N(0, D)$
- $\epsilon_i$ is the iid Gaussian noise ~ $N(0,\sigma)$
]

.pull-right[
### 2. Hazard(t) model:

$$h_i(t | M_i(t), w_i)=$$
$$lim_{\Delta \to 0} P\lbrace t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t, M_i(t), w_i\rbrace/ \Delta t =$$
$$h_0(t)exp\lbrace w_i \gamma + f(\alpha, w_i, b_i, M_i(t))\rbrace \; (2)$$
<br>
commonly used functions $f$ are
$$f:= \alpha \eta_i(t) \; (3)$$
$$f:= \alpha_1 \eta_i(t) + \alpha_2 \eta_i^{'}(t)\; (4)$$ where
$$\eta_i^{'}(t) = \frac{d\eta_i(t)}{dt}\; (5)$$

see [page 11](#12)]


---
## Specifying the Model*: Jointly

### 3. Joint log likelihood for the observed $y_i, T_i, \delta_i$:

$$l(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \sigma|D_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n log (f(y_i, T_i, \delta_i))=$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^n log(\int f_Y(y_i | b_i)f_T(T_i|b_i)f_b(b_i)db_i) =$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n log(\int f_Y(y_i | b_i)h(T_i|b_i)^{\delta_i}S(T_i|b_i)f_b(b_i)db_i)\; (6)$$
where
- $f_Y$ is the density function for $y_i$
- $f_b$ is the density function for random effect $b_i$
- $h(t)$ is the hazard function
- $S(t)$ is the survival function
- $\delta_i$ event indicator
- $b_i$ random effect within subject
- $D_n$ is the observed data
- see [page 8](#9) for $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\sigma$

## Specifying the Model: Intuition

.pull-left[

<br> <br> <br> <br>

- The model assumes $h_0(t)$ is linked with the true unobserved biomarker $\eta(t)$ through $f$

- When $f$ is defined by equation $(3)$, $h_0(t)$ and the unobserved true value
of biomarker at time $t$ are linked by scale factor $\alpha$

- When $f$ is defined by equation $(4)$, in addition to association with the 
value of biomarker at time $t$ through $\alpha_1$, $h_0(t)$ is associate with 
temporal slope of the biomarker $\alpha_2$

- Other formulations of $f$ with features such as area under the curve of the 
biomarker may inform the association between hazard and biomarker trajectories

## Specifying the Model: Generalization

The specification shared in the previous slides, is a simplification of a more 
generalized formulation given in [*An overview of joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal outcomes*](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-statistics-030718-105048) by Papageorgiou et al. 

These generalizations:

- $K$ different biomarkers being observed
- Each biomarker is allowed to have its own observation intervals
- Different types of censoring
$$\delta = \begin{cases} 0 &:& \; cens_{right} \\ 1 &:& event \\ 2 &:& cens_{left} \\3 &:& cens_{interval} \end{cases}$$
- Extends [eq(3)](#9) to generalized link (i.e. glmm)
- *Exogenous* time-dependent covariate in survival model
- Multiple TTE in competing risks setting (not included by Papageorgiou et al.)
- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` most generalized formulation turns 
out to be overly cumbersome and is (IMO) less useful in practice. Therefore, for intro
here I opted for simplified (special case) model
- Notation/flow more closely follows lecture notes by [Dr Ben French](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/person/benjamin-french) for UW SISCER 2019

## Solving the Model: Approach

#### Baseline Hazard, $h_0(t)$:
- Needed when working with the full likelihood (unlike coxph models)
- Parametric option include:
 - $h_0(t) = \lambda$
 - $h_0(t) = \lambda a t^{a-1}$
- Flexible options include:
 - Piecewise constant
 - Regression splines; e.g. B-splines
 
#### Solvers:
- Frequentist maximization of likelihood
 - EM
 - Newton-Raphson
- Bayesian
 - Integration via Laplace approximation
 - Adaptive Gaussian quadrature

## Solving the Model: In Paractice

JM framework/SW are powerful but "getting things to work" could require some 
effort

### Model accuracy $\leftrightarrow$ complexity

- Like most inference framework care parameterization pays off
- In addition to overfitting, convergence to a solution is not guaranteed 

### Estimating $h_0(t)$: flexibility $\leftrightarrow$ solution stability

- splines or piecewise constant $h_0$ are more flexible but harder to solve

### Data formatting
- Moderate your expectation of consistent/standardized (e.g. `tidy`) approach to
 data
- You may need to spend some time formatting/cleaning data.
 - Ensure conformity to required data structure
 - Align time units across TTE and longitudinal process
 - If your TTE is not death for example, you will need to manually censor 
 longitudinal data


---
## Application: Coding the Model

**1. Model longitudinal process:** Here, we are interested in treatment effect.
- Does the slope of bili differs between treatment arms?

$$log(serBilir|year, drug)=(\beta_0 + b_{0i}) + (\beta_1 + b_{1i}) year +  (\beta_2) durg:year + \epsilon_i(year)$$
$$=\eta_i(year) + \epsilon_i(year) \; (7)$$
<br>

```{r modt_build, echo = T}
mod_t <- lme(log(serBilir) ~ year + drug:year,
             random = ~ 1 + year|id, data = pbc2)
```

<br> 

The coefficients for the mixed model are:

```{r mod_t_cf, echo=FALSE}
coef(summary(mod_t))  %>% data.frame(check.names = F) %>% 
  #mutate_all(.funs = function(x) sprintf(fmt = "%.2E",x)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---
## Application: Coding the Model


**2. Model TTE:** Here, we interested in trt effect.
- Is there hazard shift associated with treatment?
- We use sex as precision variable
- `r icons::fontawesome("exclamation-triangle") %>% icons::icon_style(fill = "orange")` note the required parameter `x = T`


$$(h_i|year,drug, sex) = h_0(year) exp\lbrace (\gamma_1) drug + (\gamma_2) sex  + \alpha\eta_i(year)\rbrace \; (8)$$
<br>

```{r modcox_build, echo=TRUE}
mod_cox <- coxph(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug + sex, 
                 data = srv_d, x = T)
```

<br>

The coefficients for the coxph model are:

```{r mod_cox_cf, echo=FALSE}
mod_cox %>% broom::tidy() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

class: middle, left

## Application: Coding the Model

**3. Model JM:** Combine the two model specifications and jointly solve with defaults:
- **`parameterization = value`** i.e specification in [eq(3)](#9)
- **`method = "weibull-PH-aGH"`**  &#8594; parameterized weibull prop hazard

```{r modjm_build, echo=TRUE}
mod_jm <- jointModel(lmeObject = mod_t, survObject = mod_cox,
                     timeVar = "year")
```


---
class: middle, left

## Application: Interpreting the Model

Two sets of coefficients are generated: one characterizing the 
**longitudinal process** and another for the **TTE process**

##### I. The coefficient for the longitudinal process:

```{r modjm_cfLong, echo=TRUE}
jm_sm <- summary(mod_jm)
knitr::kable(jm_sm$`CoefTable-Long`)
```

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{year} > 0$: As time goes on
$\uparrow$ bili $\Rightarrow$ liver function $\downarrow$

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{year:drug}$ suggests no 
significant treatment effect (as was seen with KM as well)

---
class: middle, left

## Application: Interpreting the Model

##### II. The coefficient for the TTE process:

```{r modjm_cfEvent, echo=TRUE}
jm_sm <- summary(mod_jm)
knitr::kable(jm_sm$`CoefTable-Event`)
```


- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{drug}$ 
indicates that treatment does not appear protective or harmful

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")`  $\beta_{sex}$ 
suggests being female is associated with decrease hazard

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\alpha$ 
(i.e. `Assoc`) suggests $\uparrow$ bili $\Rightarrow$ hazard $\uparrow$ 


---
## Application: Dynamic Prediction

With model jointly solved, predictions connecting biomarker trajectories (e.g.
value and/or slope and/or auc etc.) to proabilities events are feasible.

```{r dyn_pred, echo= F, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10}
ND <- subset(pbc2, id==15)
survPreds <- vector('list', nrow(ND))
for(i in 1:nrow(ND)){
  set.seed(4)
  survPreds[[i]] <- survfitJM(mod_jm, newdata=ND[1:i,])}

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
for(i in c(3,6,9)){
  plot(survPreds[[i]], estimator='median', conf.int=TRUE, include.y=TRUE, pch=19, lwd=2, col='blue',
       xlab='', ylab='', ylab2='', main=paste(round(survPreds[[i]]$last.time, 1), 'years'))}
mtext('Time, years', side=1, line=-2, outer=TRUE)
mtext('log serum bilirubin', side=2, line=-1, outer=TRUE)
mtext('Survival probability', side=4, line=-1, outer=TRUE)
```
