## Motivation: Data Generation Mechanism

Multiple correlated repeated measures ~  Events that discontinue observation

## Motivation: Observed Data

What happens if the trajectories of the biomarkers are associated with the event?

## Motivation: Real Data Example

[Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_biliary_cholangitis)
is an autoimmune disease affecting liver. As 
the disease advances, abnormally high levels of serum bilirubin can be observed.

312 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo:treatment (D-penicillamine) and were observed:


```{r pbc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.retina = 3, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

srv_d <- pbc2 %>% distinct(id, age, sex, drug, years, status) %>% 
  mutate(death = if_else(status == "dead", 1, 0))
srv_ft0 <- survfit(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug , data = srv_d)
srv_ft <- survfit(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug + sex, data = srv_d)

p0 <- ggsurvplot_facet(fit = srv_ft0, facet.by = "sex", 
                 data = srv_d,palette = "jama", pval = T) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = .5, linetype = 2) + custom_theme()

# p1 <- ggsurvplot(fit = srv_ft, data = srv_d,palette = "jco",legend = "bottom")+
#   guides(colour = guide_legend(nrow = 5))

p2 <- pbc2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = log(serBilir),colour = drug)) +
  facet_wrap(~sex, nrow = 2)+
  geom_smooth()+
  geom_line(aes(group = id), alpha = .2) +
  xlab("Time (years)") +
  ylab("log (serum bilirubin)") +
  ggsci::scale_color_jama() +
  custom_theme()

p0+ p2 #+  plot_layout(widths = c(2, 1))
```

## Motivation: Real Data Example

#### Combining longitudinal and TTE

<!-- JM package provides "followup [observation of] of 312 randomized patients with  -->
<!-- primary biliary cirrhosis, a rare autoimmune liver disease, at Mayo Clinic" -->

```{r pbc_i, message=FALSE,echo=FALSE, fig.retina = 3, fig.width=10}
set.seed(9)
pbc2 %>% distinct(id) %>% 
  sample_n(size = 16,replace = F) %>%
  left_join(x = ., y = pbc2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = log(serBilir))) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=years, linetype=factor(status!='dead')), lwd=.5) + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method='lm') +
  facet_wrap(~ id) +
  scale_x_continuous(name='Time (years)', limits=c(0,15)) +
  ylab("log (serum bilirubin)")+
  scale_linetype_manual(name = "status",breaks=c(FALSE, TRUE), values=c(1, 2),
                        labels=c('death', 'censored'))+

- Relation of interest: serum bilirubin ~ death

- But death &#8594; missingness of serum bilirubin 

- This is a Missng Not at Random (MNAR) case

- Also _bili(t)_ is endogenous wrspt TTE &#8594; inappropriate as time-dependent
covariate in a survival coxph model

## Specifying the models*: longitudinal + TTE


.pull-left[
### 1. Biomarker(t) model:

$$y_i(t) = x_i(t) \beta + z_i(t) b_i + \epsilon_i(t) \; (1)$$
$$\eta_i(t) := E[y_i] = x_i(t) \beta + z_i(t) b_i$$

<br> <br> <br> 

- $y_i(t)$ is the observed value of biomarker at time $t$
- $\eta_i(t)$ is the unobserved true value of biomarker at time $t$
- $\beta$ is the vector of fix-effect parameters
- $b_i$ is the vector of random-effect parameters for subject $i$ ~ $N(0, D)$
- $\epsilon_i$ is the iid Gaussian noise ~ $N(0,\sigma)$
]

.pull-right[
### 2. Hazard(t) model:

$$h_i(t | M_i(t), w_i) :=$$
$$lim_{\Delta \to 0} P\lbrace t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t, M_i(t), w_i\rbrace/ \Delta t =$$
$$h_0(t)exp\lbrace w_i \gamma + f(\alpha, w_i, b_i, M_i(t))\rbrace \; (2)$$
<br>
commonly used functions $f$ are
$$f:= \alpha \eta_i(t) \; (3)$$
$$f:= \alpha_1 \eta_i(t) + \alpha_2 \eta_i^{'}(t)\; (4)$$ where
$$\eta_i^{'}(t) = \frac{d\eta_i(t)}{dt}\; (5)$$

see [page 11](#12)]


---
## Specifying the Model*: Jointly

### 3. Joint log likelihood for the observed $y_i, T_i, \delta_i$:

$$l(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \sigma|D_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n log (f(y_i, T_i, \delta_i))=$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^n log(\int f_Y(y_i | b_i)f_T(T_i|b_i)f_b(b_i)db_i) =$$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n log(\int f_Y(y_i | b_i)h(T_i|b_i)^{\delta_i}S(T_i|b_i)f_b(b_i)db_i)\; (6)$$
where
- $f_Y$ is the density function for $y_i$
- $f_b$ is the density function for random effect $b_i$
- $h(t)$ is the hazard function
- $S(t)$ is the survival function
- $\delta_i$ event indicator
- $b_i$ random effect within subject
- $D_n$ is the observed data
- see [page 8](#9) for $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\sigma$

## Specifying the Model: Intuition

.pull-left[

<br> <br> <br> <br>

- The model assumes $h_0(t)$ is linked with the true unobserved biomarker $\eta(t)$ through $f$

- When $f$ is defined by equation $(3)$, $h_0(t)$ and the unobserved true value
of biomarker at time $t$ are linked by scale factor $\alpha$

- When $f$ is defined by equation $(4)$, in addition to association with the 
value of biomarker at time $t$ through $\alpha_1$, $h_0(t)$ is associate with 
temporal slope of the biomarker $\alpha_2$

- Other formulations of $f$ with features such as area under the curve of the 
biomarker may inform the association between hazard and biomarker trajectories

## Specifying the Model: Generalization

The specification shared in the previous slides, is a simplification of a more 
generalized formulation given in [*An overview of joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal outcomes*](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-statistics-030718-105048) by Papageorgiou et al. 

These generalizations:

- $K$ different biomarkers being observed
- Each biomarker is allowed to have its own observation intervals
- Different types of censoring
$$\delta = \begin{cases} 0 &:& \; cens_{right} \\ 1 &:& event \\ 2 &:& cens_{left} \\3 &:& cens_{interval} \end{cases}$$
- Extends [eq(3)](#9) to generalized link (i.e. glmm)
- *Exogenous* time-dependent covariate in survival model
- Multiple TTE in competing risks setting (not included by Papageorgiou et al.)
- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` most generalized formulation turns 
out to be overly cumbersome and is (IMO) less useful in practice. Therefore, for intro
here I opted for simplified (special case) model
- Notation/flow more closely follows lecture notes by [Dr Ben French](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/person/benjamin-french) for UW SISCER 2019

## Solving the Model: Approach

#### Baseline Hazard, $h_0(t)$:
- Needed when working with the full likelihood (unlike coxph models)
- Parametric option include:
 - $h_0(t) = \lambda$
 - $h_0(t) = \lambda a t^{a-1}$
- Flexible options include:
 - Piecewise constant
 - Regression splines; e.g. B-splines
 
#### Solvers:
- Frequentist maximization of likelihood
 - EM
 - Newton-Raphson
- Bayesian
 - Integration via Laplace approximation
 - Adaptive Gaussian quadrature

## Solving the Model: In Paractice

JM framework/SW are powerful but "getting things to work" could require some 
effort

### Model accuracy $\leftrightarrow$ complexity

- Like most inference framework care parameterization pays off
- In addition to overfitting, convergence to a solution is not guaranteed 

### Estimating $h_0(t)$: flexibility $\leftrightarrow$ solution stability

- splines or piecewise constant $h_0$ are more flexible but harder to solve

### Data formatting
- Moderate your expectation of consistent/standardized (e.g. `tidy`) approach to
 data
- You may need to spend some time formatting/cleaning data.
 - Ensure conformity to required data structure
 - Align time units across TTE and longitudinal process
 - If your TTE is not death for example, you will need to manually censor 
 longitudinal data


---
## Application: Coding the Model

**1. Model longitudinal process:** Here, we are interested in treatment effect.
- Does the slope of bili differs between treatment arms?

$$log(serBilir|year, drug)=(\beta_0 + b_{0i}) + (\beta_1 + b_{1i}) year +  (\beta_2) durg:year + \epsilon_i(year)$$
$$=\eta_i(year) + \epsilon_i(year) \; (7)$$
<br>

```{r modt_build, echo = T}
mod_t <- lme(log(serBilir) ~ year + drug:year,
             random = ~ 1 + year|id, data = pbc2)
```

<br> 

The coefficients for the mixed model are:

```{r mod_t_cf, echo=FALSE}
coef(summary(mod_t))  %>% data.frame(check.names = F) %>% 
  #mutate_all(.funs = function(x) sprintf(fmt = "%.2E",x)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

---
## Application: Coding the Model


**2. Model TTE:** Here, we interested in trt effect.
- Is there hazard shift associated with treatment?
- We use sex as precision variable
- `r icons::fontawesome("exclamation-triangle") %>% icons::icon_style(fill = "orange")` note the required parameter `x = T`


$$(h_i|year,drug, sex) = h_0(year) exp\lbrace (\gamma_1) drug + (\gamma_2) sex  + \alpha\eta_i(year)\rbrace \; (8)$$
<br>

```{r modcox_build, echo=TRUE}
mod_cox <- coxph(Surv(time = years, event = death) ~ drug + sex, 
                 data = srv_d, x = T)
```

<br>

The coefficients for the coxph model are:

```{r mod_cox_cf, echo=FALSE}
mod_cox %>% broom::tidy() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Application: Coding the Model

**3. Model JM:** Combine the two model specifications and jointly solve with defaults:
- **`parameterization = value`** i.e specification in [eq(3)](#9)
- **`method = "weibull-PH-aGH"`**  &#8594; parameterized Weibull prop hazard

```{r modjm_build, echo=TRUE}
mod_jm <- jointModel(lmeObject = mod_t, survObject = mod_cox,
                     timeVar = "year")
```


---
class: middle, left

## Application: Interpreting the Model

Two sets of coefficients are generated: one characterizing the 
**longitudinal process** and another for the **TTE process**

##### I. The coefficient for the longitudinal process:

```{r modjm_cfLong, echo=TRUE}
jm_sm <- summary(mod_jm)
knitr::kable(jm_sm$`CoefTable-Long`)
```

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{year} > 0$: As time goes on
$\uparrow$ bili $\Rightarrow$ liver function $\downarrow$

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{year:drug}$ suggests no 
significant treatment effect (as was seen with KM as well


---
class: middle, left

## Application: Interpreting the Model

##### II. The coefficient for the TTE process:

```{r modjm_cfEvent, echo=TRUE}
jm_sm <- summary(mod_jm)
knitr::kable(jm_sm$`CoefTable-Event`)
```


- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\beta_{drug}$ 
indicates that treatment does not appear protective or harmful

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")`  $\beta_{sex}$ 
suggests being female is associated with decrease hazard

- `r icons::fontawesome("hand-point-right")` $\alpha$ 
(i.e. `Assoc`) suggests $\uparrow$ bili $\Rightarrow$ hazard $\uparrow$ 


---
## Application: Dynamic Prediction

With model jointly solved, predictions connecting biomarker trajectories (e.g.
value and/or slope and/or auc etc.) to probabilities events are feasible.

```{r dyn_pred_val, echo= F, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10}
ND <- subset(pbc2, id==15)
survPreds <- vector('list', nrow(ND))
for(i in 1:nrow(ND)){
  set.seed(4)
  survPreds[[i]] <- survfitJM(mod_jm, newdata=ND[1:i,])}

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
for(i in c(3,6,9)){
  plot(survPreds[[i]], estimator='median', conf.int=TRUE, include.y=TRUE, pch=19, lwd=2, col='blue',
       xlab='', ylab='', ylab2='', main=paste(round(survPreds[[i]]$last.time, 1), 'years'))}

## Application: Coding the Model with `both` Value and Slope

**3. Model JM:** Combine the two model specifications and jointly solve with defaults:
- **`parameterization = both`** i.e specification in [eq(3)](#9)
- **`method = "weibull-PH-aGH"`**  &#8594; parameterized Weibull prop hazard

```{r modjmboth_build, echo=TRUE}

# Simulation case study: </br> Longitudinal biomarker data with biomarker-level associated missingness 

---
## Case Study Intro

In clinical reserach, often health measurements are collected from patients over 
time to monitor each patient's general wellbing as well as clinical response to 
the intervention administered. For example, a blood test could measure a protein
which can be a surrogate for inflammation or organ function. Of interest to 
clinicians and researchers would be what the information content of each 
patient's profile tell us about the patient's health, response to treatment or 
likelihood of adverse events. Learning the signal in information content of 
longitudinal profiles often requires considering features inherent to this family
of data:

1. The temporal observations are correlated across time
2. If mutliple biomarkers are collected, correlation could also exist across 
biomarkers
3. The temporal profiles are "smooth" over time and often show higher order 
trends (i.e. have curvature)
4. Sometimes the value of the biomarkers inform missigness. For example, if the
biomarker measures failure of an organ, it is reasonable to expect that 
likelihood of mortality and thereby missingness in follow up observations 
increases with increase in the value of the biomarker.

With these factors in  mind, we seek to simulate a data that achieves some of 
these features so to enable evaluation of modeling choices


---
## Set up

### Group mean model

First we create two prototypical profiles

```{r mean_model_code, message=FALSE}
knots <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)
theta <-cbind(
  grp1 = c(0.1, 0.9, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1),
  grp2 = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1))


t_obs <- 1:30
t_obs.normalize <- (t_obs - min(t_obs))/(max(t_obs) - min(t_obs))
basis <- splines::bs(x = t_obs.normalize, knots = knots, degree = 3, 
                     Boundary.knots = c(0, 1), intercept = TRUE)
y_spline <- basis %*% theta

mu_profiles_true <- data.frame(t_obs, y_spline) %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = -t_obs, names_to = "grps",
                      values_to = "mu_true")

```

---

### Group mean model: plot

```{r mean_model_plot,  fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, message=FALSE}
mu_profiles_true %>%
  ggplot(aes(t_obs,y= mu_true,group=grps, color = grps)) + 
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(size = 1.2) +
  ggsci::scale_color_jama()
```

---
### Generating time series from mean model

Using the mean model `mu_profiles_true` and an auto-regressive order 1 (AR1) 
correlation structure, we generate longitudinal profiles assuming individual 
random effect and observation noise drawn from normal distribution. (compare 
[eq(7)](#29) to [eq(1)](#8) note lack of baseline)

$$y_i(t) = z_i(t) b_i + \epsilon_i(t) \; (7)$$

```{r tseries_nobaseline , message=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
sim_ts_nobaseline <- sim_ts(mu_profiles_true = mu_profiles_true, rho_ar1 = .6)
```

```{r tseries_nobaseline_plot,  fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, echo=F, message=F}
sim_ts_nobaseline %>%

### Adding the baseline to individual profiles: mixed effect t-series

The baseline adds sets 3 sets of feature-sets, each feature sets is correlated
within featureset and uncorrelated between feature-set. While this level of
complexity is not necessary, it  more closely mimics biological measurements 
(e.g. correlated cytokines like IL-5 and IL-6 or correlated gene expressions).
Here, the correlated featuresets were sampled from  multivariate normal with a 
block diagonal covariance matrix. 

```{r tseries,   message=FALSE}
add_baseline(sim_ts = sim_ts_nobaseline) -> sim_dts
```


```{r baseline_core, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, echo = F, message=F}
sim_dts %>% 
  select(subjid,contains("baseline")) %>% 
  distinct() %>% select(-subjid) %>% cor() %>%
  corrplot::corrplot()
```

###  Mixed effect t-series: visualized

The generated data now matches  a rendition of [eq(1)](#8), where we have 
AR1 cor at unit (individual level) under gaussian random effect model, random
gaussian observation noise and baseline factors (fixed-effect), all added on top
of the two group mean profiles `mu_profiles_true`.

```{r tseries_vis, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, echo=F, message=F}
sim_dts %>% 
  slice_sample(prop = .5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = t_obs,y = y, color = grps)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2) + 
  geom_line( aes(group = subjid), alpha = .2) +

### Adding missingness: intuition

At this point, our data has no missing value. Everyone is observed from day 1 
through day 30. Here we would like to impose a missingness the likelihood of 
which is dictated by the value of each patient's biomarker.

Here, we seek to find when a patient experiences an event (e.g. death) making 
the patient drop out of the observed group. We only observe for 30 days. Beyond 
30 days, all are "censored" (i.e. no event observed during observation window). 
We then go through each patient profile at each time-point and "flip a coin", 
so-to-speak, and if head we mark the patient to experience the event. We can 
think of this coin to be weighted such that the higher the value of the 
biomarker gets, the higher likelihood of head.

### Adding missingness using ITS

But how do we exactly sample from a distribution that is adjusted  to the  value
of biomarker?  Given the mixed-effect longitudinal process simulated and the 
distributional assumption of $h_0(t)$ as weibull, we have the hazard function, 
$h(t)$ defined by [eq(1)](#8).

Based on definition of hazard, we know:
$$ h(t) := lim_{\Delta \to 0} P\lbrace t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t, 
M_i(t), w_i\rbrace/ \Delta t = f(t)/S(t) = $$

$$ -\frac{d}{dt} ln[1-F(t)] = - \frac{d}{dt} ln[S(t)]\; (8)$$

Integrating both sides from T=0 to T=t, we have

$$H(t) = -ln[S(t)]\; (9)$$
We recall that $S(t)$ is the CDF of event distribution and that given 
[eq(9)](#33) we can get $S(t)$ from numerical integration of $h(t)$. With 
CDF(t,i) being available, we can now use the general inverse transform sampling 
$$X \sim F^{-1}_X (U) \;(10)$$
to sample from $f(t, i)$ via  
$$f(t, i) \sim S^{-1}_{t,i}(U_i)\; (11)$$

---
### Adding missingness using ITS: code for inverse S

So based on [eq(11)](#33), to access $f(t,i)$, we simply sample for each subject
$i$, from $U$. we then feed that into inverse survival function for subject $i$
at time $t$, $S(t,i)$ to map uniform sampling distribution to time and 
subject-specific event probability distribution.

First, we define $S^{-1}_{t,i}$ `surv_inv`

```{r ITS_code_sinv, echo=TRUE}
surv_inv <- function (t, sim_dts_i, u_i, gamma_x_i) {
  
  # h() is the hazard function and we assume a Weibull baseline hazard
  h <- function (s) {
    # the linear predictor from the mixed model evaluated at time s
    f <- as.vector(approxfun(x = sim_dts_i$t_obs_n,y = sim_dts_i$y_bar)(s))
    exp(log(shape_wb) + (shape_wb - 1) * log(s) +  gamma_x_i  + f * alpha )
  }
  
  # -log(S(t)) = H(t), where H(t) is the cumulative hazard function
  log_s <- - integrate(h, lower = 0, upper = t)$value
  obj <- - log_s  + log(u_i)
  return(obj)
}
```

### Adding missingness using ITS: code



```{r ITS_code}
upp_cens <- 30 # fixed Type I censoring time
shape_wb <- 1.5 # shape Weibull
alpha <- 3 # association coefficients

event_time <- sim_dts %>% 
  distinct(subjid, gamma_x) %>%
  mutate(u = runif(n = nrow(.))) %>%
  mutate(t_event = NA) %>%
  mutate(t_event = as.numeric(NA))

for (i in 1:nrow(event_time)) {
  up <- .95
  subj_i <- event_time %>% slice(i) %>% pull(subjid)
  u_i <-  event_time %>% slice(i) %>% pull(u)
  gamma_x_i <- event_time %>% slice(i)  %>% pull(gamma_x)
  sim_dts_i <- sim_dts %>% dplyr::filter(subjid == subj_i)
  
  t_root <- try(uniroot(surv_inv,
                        interval = c(0+1e-05, up),
                        sim_dts_i = sim_dts_i, u_i = u_i, 
                        gamma_x_i = gamma_x_i)$root, TRUE)
  event_time$t_event[i] <- if (!inherits(t_root, "try-error")) t_root else 1.2
}

```

### Adding missingness using ITS: event distribution

For visual inspection, we can plot and make sure that likelihood of events 
follows the trend value overall

```{r event_dist, fig.height=6, fig.width= 10, echo=F, message=F}
event_time <- event_time %>% 
  mutate(t_event = t_event * (max(t_obs) - min(t_obs)) + min(t_obs)) %>%
  mutate(event = if_else(t_event < upp_cens, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(t_event = pmin(t_event, upp_cens))

event_time %>% ggplot(aes(x = t_event)) + geom_histogram()
```

---
### Adding missingness to biomarker data
With events simulated, we can superimpose event time on biomarker and clean up
<!-- With events simulated, we join the event with longitudinal profile. We then want -->
<!--  to clean the data such that observations after event time-points are dropped ( -->
<!--  it doesn't make sense for an observation to be recorded after let's say a  -->
<!--  patient's death) -->
```{r tseries_attenuate, message=FALSE}
sim_dts_tte <- left_join(sim_dts,y = event_time) %>% filter(t_obs <= t_event) %>%
  group_by(subjid) %>% mutate(event_point = if_else(event == 1 & t_obs == max(t_obs),"Y","N")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% select(subjid, grps,contains("baseline"), t_obs,mu_true, y, t_event, event, event_point)

```


```{r tseries_attenuate_vis,fig.height=5, fig.width= 10, echo=F, message=F}
g <- sim_dts_tte %>% 
  group_by(subjid) %>%
  mutate(event_point = if_else(event == 1 & t_obs == max(t_obs),"Y","N")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = t_obs,y = y, color = grps, subjid = subjid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .2,aes(shape = event_point)) + 
  geom_point(data = sim_dts_tte %>% filter(event_point == "Y"),aes(shape = event_point)) + 
  geom_line( aes(group = subjid), alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = grps)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mu_true), linetype = 2, size = 1.5)+
  ggsci::scale_color_jama() +
  xlab("Observation Day")

## Inference

Building the model:

```{r sim_inference, message=FALSE}
library(JM)
mod_t <- lme(y ~ ns(t_obs, 3) * grps, data = sim_dts_tte, random = ~ t_obs| subjid,
          control = lmeControl(opt = "optim"))

mod_cox <- coxph(Surv(time = t_obs, event = event) ~ baseline1 + baseline2 + baseline3 +
                   baseline4 + baseline5 + baseline6 +
                   baseline7 + baseline8 + baseline9,
                 data = sim_dts_tte %>% select(subjid,contains("baseline"),t_event,event) %>%
                   distinct() %>%
                   rename(t_obs = t_event),
                 x = T)
```

### Visualizing the mixed-model fit for a sampling of the simulated patients

```{r sim_mm_fit, fig.height=5, fig.width= 10, echo=F, message=F}
mod_t$data %>% bind_cols(., fitted =   mod_t$fitted[,2]) %>%

###Running the model and summarizing the inference

Recall the simulation [parameter](#36) $\alpha =$ `r alpha`
```{r}
mod_jm <- jointModel(lmeObject = mod_t, survObject = mod_cox, timeVar = "t_obs")
jmmod_sum <- summary(mod_jm)
cf_events <- jmmod_sum$`CoefTable-Event`
rownames(cf_events) <- replace(rownames(cf_events),
                               rownames(cf_events) == "Assoct", "alpha")
cf_events <- cf_events[c(c("alpha","log(shape)"), 
                       setdiff(rownames(cf_events),c("alpha","log(shape)"))),]
DT::datatable(cf_events, options = list(pageLength = 5)) %>% 
  DT::formatRound(columns=colnames(cf_events), digits=3)
```
