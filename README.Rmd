# Joint Modeling: An Intro

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of this repo is to review statistical approach for jointly modeling 
data that is comprised of inter-related time-to-event and longitudinal 
observations. 

This is done leveraging the Review Article [*An overview of joint modeling of time-to-event and longitudinal outcomes*](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-statistics-030718-105048) and
is *loosely* based on that.
